The QA Assistant makes the process of QAing a novel or other piece of writing easy!

This add-on displays common proofreading-related issues and errors, along with the number of occurrences of each issue. Whenever possible, it provides regexes which you can use to search your document for those issues.

It does:
```
▸ check for common typos
▸ check for common punctuation errors
▸ check for commonly confused words
▸ prefer American spellings
▸ use Merriam-Webster's preferred spellings
```

It does not:
```
▸ make changes for you
▸ alter your document in any way
▸ store any of your data
▸ view any of your data, apart from the document it's installed in
```
