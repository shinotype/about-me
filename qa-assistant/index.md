# QA Assistant

 ![Screenshot of the QA Assistant](assist.png)

The QA Assistant is a tool to make the process of QAing a novel or other piece of writing easier. This add-on displays common proofreading-related issues and errors, along with the number of occurrences of each issue. Whenever possible, it provides regexes which you can use to search your document for said issues. 

**It does:**
* Check for common typos (e.g. woah -> whoa)
* Check for common punctuation-related errors (e.g. two spaces in a row)
* Check for commonly confused words (e.g. discrete vs discreet)
* Prefer Merriam-Webster's spellings
* Prefer American spellings in general

**It does not:**
* Make changes for you
* Alter your document in any way
* Store any of your data
* View any of your data, apart from the document which it's checking
